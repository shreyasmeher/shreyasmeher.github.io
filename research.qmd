My research focuses on computational social science approaches to studying internet censorship, political communication, and conflict. I use natural language processing and machine learning methods to analyze political phenomena.

### Interest Group Communication Strategies During COVID-19
*with Sushant Kumar & Pengfei Zhang*  
**Revise & Resubmit at Behavioral Sciences**

Analyzing how health advocacy groups adapted their Medicare-For-All messaging on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing distinct approaches to public engagement and narrative adaptation. 


## Working Papers

### Democracy and Internet Control: Theory and Evidence from Transparency Reports
*with Pengfei Zhang*

Examining how democratic and authoritarian regimes differ in their approach to internet content moderation, using data from transparency reports. We find that while both regime types remove similar amounts of content, their methods and motivations differ significantly. [PDF](research/democracy-and-internet-control.pdf)

### ConfliBERT: Foundation Models for Political Violence Analysis
*with Patrick T. Brandt, Sultan Alsarra, Vito D'Orazio, Dagmar Heintze, Latifur Khan, Javier Osorio, and Marcus Sianan*

Developing specialized language models for political conflict analysis that outperform general-purpose LLMs like Gemma 2, Llama 3.1, and Qwen 2.5 in accuracy, precision, and recall while being hundreds of times faster. [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15060)

### Two Types of Censorship? An Assessment of the Informational Autocracy Thesis
Testing how Guriev & Treisman's Informational Autocracy theory applies to internet filtering practices in autocratic nations, with a focus on regime strategies and implementation methods. [PDF](research/two-types-censorship.pdf)

### ConflLlama-Q: Efficient Adaptation of LLMs for Conflict Event Classification
*with Patrick T. Brandt*

Demonstrating how efficient adaptation of large language models can dramatically improve conflict event classification. Through quantization-aware fine-tuning of LLaMA-3.1, we achieve a 37.6% improvement over the base model, with specific attack type classifications improving by up to 1463%.

### Media Polarization in International News Coverage
*with Arslan Khalid & Kiwan Park*

Using machine learning to analyze ideological patterns in international news coverage across 200,000+ articles, examining shifts in sentiment and framing before and after the 2016 US election. 

## Ongoing Projects

### Populism and Investment Treaties
*with Clint Peinhardt*

Investigating how nationalist rhetoric influences countries' decisions to exit international investment agreements.

### IGO Withdrawal Networks
Extending Borzyskowski & Vabulas (2019) to examine network effects in international organization withdrawals.
