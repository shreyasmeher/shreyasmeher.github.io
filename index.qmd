## About 

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Policy, Politics, and Society group at the Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Erasmus University Rotterdam. My research leverages computational methods to address core questions in comparative politics, digital governance, and international relations.

Currently, as part of the Horizon Europe **TWIN4DEM** project, I develop machine learning frameworks to model and detect democratic backsliding. My substantive focus is on **executive aggrandizement**â€”the process by which elected leaders systematically weaken democratic institutions to consolidate power. My work involves creating the algorithmic core for 'digital twins' of political systems, which allows for the simulation and analysis of threats to democratic resilience.

My broader research agenda explores:

-   **Censorship & Digital Sovereignty:** Analyzing how different regime types implement internet control, from subtle content moderation in democracies to overt filtering and blackouts in autocracies.

-   **Computational Methods & Political Conflict:** Building specialized language models for structured political event classification. Previously, as a researcher on a major NSF-funded project, I developed models like **ConfliBERT** and **ConflLlama** and applied reinforcement learning to enhance event data annotation, and I remain an active contributor to this line of research.

-   **International Political Economy:** The politics of investment treaties and the network effects within international organizations.

Methodologically, I specialize in computational text analysis, reinforcement learning, and the application of LLMs to political science research in HPC environments.

## Current Research

### Postdoctoral Researcher, TWIN4DEM Project
**Erasmus University Rotterdam (June 2024-Present)** As a researcher on the [TWIN4DEM (Strengthening Democratic Resilience Through Digital Twins)](https://twin4dem.eu/) project, my work focuses on developing the machine learning frameworks that power the project's 'digital twins' of European democracies. I am responsible for pre-training and fine-tuning large language models to identify signals of executive aggrandizement from political text and designing the simulation algorithms that form the core of the project's models.

## Dissertation
