Additionally, as we are required to add to the database, we look to use web scraping tools such as BeautifulSoup to further expand the dataset (possibly bring in news media from outside the U.S. such as Al Jazeera). \n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n### Authors - Arslan Khalid, Kiwan Park, Shreyas Meher\n\n### Media Coverage of U.S. Foreign Policy\n\n#### Area/Topic \n\nThe news media often regards itself as the fourth branch of government.
