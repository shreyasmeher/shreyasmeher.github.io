### Professionally

I am a PhD Candidate in Public Policy & Political Economy at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research bridges the gap between political science and computational linguistics, focusing on areas such as global finance, economic development, and the impact of internet censorship in different political regimes. I have been actively involved in the ConfliBERT Research Lab with Dr. Patrick Brandt, contributing to the development of a language model for analyzing political conflict and violence. My upcoming work includes papers related to internet censorship and electoral accountability (with Dr. Pengfei Zhang) along with my dissertation on internet censorship across various regimes. 

### Personally

I'm an avid football fan, rooting for Inter Milan, and a culinary enthusiast who loves exploring and creating new Dim Sum recipes.
