## About

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Policy, Politics, and Society group at Erasmus University Rotterdam.

I earned my Ph.D. in Public Policy & Political Economy from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2025. My foundational work on computational methods for political science was developed in close collaboration with Dr. [Patrick T. Brandt](https://www.utdallas.edu/~pbrandt/) through the NSF-funded ConfliBERT project. My research applies methods from Computational Social Science to address substantive questions in Digital Governance, particularly online censorship, and the dynamics of Democratic Backsliding.

As a researcher on the **[TWIN4DEM project](https://twin4dem.eu/)**, I work with **[Clara Egger](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://claraegger.com/)** and **[Asya Zhelyazkova](https://www.eur.nl/people/asya-zhelyazkova)** to develop machine learning frameworks for modeling democratic processes. My role involves building the technical core for 'digital twins'â€”advanced simulations used to analyze the causes of democratic erosion, such as executive aggrandizement, and to assess institutional resilience.

## Research Interests

::: {.panel-tabset}

### {{< fa solid eye-slash >}} Digital Governance

My research in this area focuses on how different regimes implement internet control. I analyze everything from subtle content moderation in democracies to overt filtering and internet blackouts in autocracies, with a core focus on the concept of **Digital Sovereignty**.

### {{< fa solid laptop-code >}} Computational Social Science

I build and apply specialized language models to study political phenomena. This work, stemming from my contributions to the NSF-funded **ConfliBERT** and **ConflLlama** projects, leverages NLP and reinforcement learning to create structured data from unstructured text, primarily in the domain of political conflict.

### {{< fa solid landmark-dome >}} International Political Economy

My work in IPE examines the politics of international cooperation and withdrawal. I use network analysis and quantitative methods to study why countries exit bilateral investment treaties and the cascading effects of withdrawals from international organizations.

Methodologically, I specialize in computational text analysis, reinforcement learning, and the application of LLMs to political science research in HPC environments.
