## About

I am a PhD Candidate in Public Policy & Political Economy at the University of Texas at Dallas, working on an NSF-funded research project to develop frameworks for political and social event data using machine learning. My research combines computational methods with political science, particularly focusing on political control in digital spaces, international political economy, and conflict analysis. I specialize in developing and optimizing large language models for political science applications, including ConfliBERT and ConflLlama.

## Research Interests

- **Comparative Politics**: Internet Control, Digital Governance, Autocratic Regimes
- **International Political Economy**: Investment Treaties, Economic Development
- **Computational Social Science**: Large Language Models, Political Text Analysis
- **Political Conflict**: Violence Analysis, Event Data Collection

## Current Research

### ConfliBERT Project
Research Assistant with [Dr. Patrick Brandt](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~pxb054000/) (2022-present)  
Developing state-of-the-art language models for analyzing political conflict and violence.

## Dissertation
"Democracy and Internet Control: Theory and Evidence from Transparency Reports"  
*An analysis of content moderation and electoral accountability across regime types.*
