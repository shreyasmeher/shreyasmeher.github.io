My research uses computational methods to address core questions in three areas: **digital governance and censorship**, the dynamics of **political conflict**, and the causes and consequences of **democratic backsliding**. I specialize in applying natural language processing and machine learning to analyze political behavior and institutions.

## Under Review

### Democracy and Internet Control: Theory and Evidence from Transparency Reports
*with [Pengfei Zhang](https://pengfei-zhang.com/)*

Examining how democratic and authoritarian regimes differ in their approach to internet content moderation, using data from transparency reports. We find that while both regime types remove similar amounts of content, their methods and motivations differ significantly. 

### Two Types of Censorship? An Assessment of the Informational Autocracy Thesis 
*with [Pengfei Zhang](https://pengfei-zhang.com/)*

Testing how Guriev & Treisman's Informational Autocracy theory applies to internet filtering practices in autocratic nations, with a focus on regime strategies and implementation methods. 

## Working Papers

### Populism and Investment Treaties
*with [Clint Peinhardt](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/clint.peinhardt)*

Investigating how nationalist rhetoric influences countries' decisions to exit international investment agreements.

### IGO Withdrawal Networks
Extending Borzyskowski & Vabulas (2019) to examine network effects in international organization withdrawals.

### Media Polarization in International News Coverage
*with Arslan Khalid & Kiwan Park*

Using machine learning to analyze ideological patterns in international news coverage across 200,000+ articles, examining shifts in sentiment and framing before and after the 2016 US election.

### Event Horizon: Revolutionizing Data Annotation with Reinforcement Learning  
Introducing a novel reinforcement learning framework built on deepseek's GRPO, merging political science with advanced AI to create structured, transparent annotations for complex events.
