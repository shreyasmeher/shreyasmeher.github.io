## About  

I am a PhD in Public Policy & Political Economy from the University of Texas at Dallas and an incoming Postdoctoral Researcher at Erasmus University Rotterdam (starting June 2025). My research examines how governments control political speech in digital spaces, the role of economic and political institutions in shaping international cooperation, and how large language models can enhance event data collection.

Broadly, my work explores:  
- **Censorship & Digital Governance:** How regimes use internet control, legal frameworks, and platform policies to shape online discourse.  
- **International Political Economy:** The politics of investment treaties, populist-driven economic exits, and network effects in international organizations.  
- **Political Conflict & Event Data:** Using machine learning and reinforcement learning to improve structured conflict event classification.  

Methodologically, I specialize in computational approaches to political text analysis, reinforcement learning for structured output generation, and the application of large language models (LLMs) to political science. I developed **ConfliBERT** and **ConflLlama**, fine-tuned models for political event classification, and am currently building an RL-based annotation framework using Deepseekâ€™s GRPO.
