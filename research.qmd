## Democracy and Internet Control: Theory and Evidence from Transparency Reports (with Pengfei Zhang)

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Abstract
Internet control has long been considered a feature of authoritarian regimes alone. Drawing data from Google and Twitter transparency reports, we observe that democratic countries remove an equal amount of content as their authoritarian counterparts. The distinction between the two regimes lies not in the quantity but in the method of content removal. Democracy refrains from government takedown and instead delegates the removal right to the users. This paper conjectures that politicians' reputation concern is the key to understanding this phenomenon. To that end, we develop a political agency model that explains the stylized facts and derives testable hypotheses. Using the timing of elections as a natural experiment, we provide supporting evidence that the takedown requests from democratic governments decreased significantly as the election approached. This reputation effect is not observed in authoritarian regimes or other types of requests.

## Two Types of Censorship (with Pengfei Zhang)
::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Abstract
Commentators have long observed significant differences in national internet-filtering strategies, with some described as censorship and some as moderation. This paper presents the first taxonomy of internet filtering regimes around the world. Internet filtering behaviors are measured by the cross-country data from OpenNet Initiative and the Freedom House. Using an unsupervised learning technique of cluster analysis, we group the governments' filtering behaviors based on multi-dimensional indicators of internet access, content restriction, and technological barriers.
We discover four distinct regime types: pervasive control regime (e.g., China), influence operation regime (e.g., Russia), user empowerment regime (e.g., the United States), and selective intervention regime (e.g., Singapore). 
The four regime types are supported by country-specfic studies. We also use the four regime types to predict socio-economic outcomes.  Among them, we find regimes differ significantly in their volume and validity of removal requests to Google. We provide a political economy explanation for understanding the differences and similarities between the four regime types. Every regime type is a result of the institutional trade-off between the censorship risk and the pandering risk.

## How do Interest Groups adapt their Communication Strategy to Big Shocks? An analysis of the Medicare-For-All Debate on Twitter during COVID-19. (With Sushant Kumar & Pengfei Zhang)

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Abstract 

COVID-19 has reinvigorated the policy debate for a universal healthcare system, attracting much attention on social media. In this paper, we study the online discourse of Medicare-For-All before and after COVID-19 by examining the Twitter feeds of two opposing health advocacy groups -- Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP) and Partnership for America’s Healthcare Future (P4AHCF). Our empirical results show a sharp contrast between the two interest groups’ communication strategies. PNHP’s tweets show more personalized stories, whereas P4AHCF’s tweets show more statistics and scientific reports. The difference in text styles is consequential. PNHP has higher engagement of Twitter users and is more adaptive to a pandemic narrative. By contrast, P4AHCF stopped tweeting entirely about Medicare-For-All after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. We argue that the distinctive social media strategies can be explained by the groups’ different audiences and objectives. The findings add to our understanding of American’s activism on social media and the implication of the pandemic for health policy reform.

## Polarization within U.S. Foreign Media (With Arslan Khalid & Kiwan Park)
::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Abstract

In today's highly polarized media landscape, understanding the potential biases
and relationships between news publications has become increasingly important. This study
aims to investigate the existence of media bias by examining the content of online news
articles. We leverage a dataset containing over 200,000 articles from various media outlets,
spanning diverse political orientations and subject matter. Using unsupervised machine
learning techniques, we first employ clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical
clustering, to group similar articles based on their content. This analysis enables us to
identify patterns and common themes within the clusters, shedding light on the potential
ideological leanings of the publications. Our DID analysis shows that, on average, there is a
slight negative shift in sentiment scores before and after the 2016 US presidential election for
articles published by liberal-leaning publications compared to those published by
conservative-leaning publications. The regression analysis indicates that the ideological
leaning of the publication was significantly associated with the overall sentiment score of
articles, with liberal-leaning publications having higher sentiment scores on average
compared to conservative-leaning publications.

## Introducing the ConfliBERT Family of Language Models for Political Science (with Patrick Brandt, Vito D'Orazio & Javier Osorio)

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Abstract
For decades, conflict scholars used rule-based approaches to extract information about political violence from newspapers around the world with limited results. Recent technological development in Natural Language Processing allowed us to overcome the rigidity of rule-based approaches. We review our recent ConfliBERT language model (Hu et al. 2022) and its applications in political science.  ConfliBERT is a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically developed to process text related to politics and violence. It was trained on a large domain-specific corpus in English with text related to conflict, political violence, and international politics with global coverage. When fine-tuned, results show that ConfliBERT has superior performance over other LLMs within its relevant domains. We then discuss multi-lingual extensions of ConfliBERT for Spanish and Arabic source texts and show that ConfliBERT also outperforms alternative models in their native languages. Finally, we discuss limitations of the models and propose further extensions.

# Large Language Models

## ConfliBERT Usage Manual & Finetuning guide (With ConfliBERT Lab)

This document (continually updated!) walks political scientists through the usage of a Large Language Model (LLM) on various tasks such as classification, masking, named entity recognition & question answering. Furthermore, the document outlines the process of finetuning the LLM on the users datasets with the help of a Google Colab script.
